# Hill-Climbing-Optimization-Technique
A Heuristic-based approach for a large set of inputs using Hill climbing Optimization technique

Hill Climbing is an iterative optimization algorithm that starts with an initial solution and tries to improve it by iteratively moving to neighboring solutions that have a better evaluation. The algorithm terminates when it reaches a local optimum where no better solution can be found in the immediate neighborhood.

Here's a general outline of the Hill Climbing algorithm:

1. Define the problem space and the evaluation function:

- Determine the representation of the solutions.
- Define the evaluation function that assigns a score or value to each solution.

2. Initialize the current solution:

- Generate an initial solution randomly or through some other method.

3. Iterate until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or no improvement):

- Generate neighboring solutions:
     - Define the neighborhood structure based on the problem domain. This could involve making small modifications to the current solution.
- Evaluate the neighboring solutions using the evaluation function.
- Select the best neighboring solution as the current solution if it has a higher evaluation value.
- If the current solution is the best solution found so far, update the best solution.

4. Return the best solution found.

The implementation of this general framework will require customizing the steps based on your specific problem and domain. For example, in a scheduling problem, the representation of solutions might involve assigning tasks to time slots, and the evaluation function could consider factors like deadlines, resource utilization, or preferences.
